This conversation reminded me again of what I witnessed when I was worked as a UX intern in a design studio: my design colleagues kept running back and forth, getting feedback from the development team and adding things that they had neglected or editing things that didn't work. </p>

                                <p>As a designer who knows how to code, I also experienced some muddles leaving comments or annotations on my prototypes, explaining details of interactions and creating different states of an icon button with a carefully worded label beside:</p>

                                <h6>Key Problems</h6>
                                <p>Based on my observations and previous talks with different UX/UI designers, I realized the following obstacles that make the communication hard:</p>
                                <li>When designing, designers neglect important details that create gaps in their designs. Therefore, developers either fill in the blank with their imagination (which is likely to result in more conflicts) or repeatedly ask for specifications.</li>
                                <li>When communicating, designers are not able to use engineering language to explain their thoughts or understand questions raised with these jargons and terms.</li>
                                <h6>Opportunity Areas</h6>
                                <p>Therefore, I found these two opportunity areas</p>
                                <li>Helping designers specifying their design</li>
                                <li>Helping designers delivering their design in engineering language</li>
                                <h6>Design Requirements</h6>
                                <p>To better fit into the existing design flow with ease, I defined that the final design should be: </p>

                                <p>I scoped my design according to the requirements and decided to focus on <b>simple scenarios</b> when designers are designing and later delivering very simple components/pages with basic UI elements such as buttons, inputs and result lists.

                                <p>I decided to help designers specify their design with:</p>
                                <li>① A checklist of easy-to-forget details</li>
                                <li>② A need-to-be-specified list of different component states with engineering language label and designer language decription</li>
                                <li>③ A design-to-dev notes with fill-in-the-blank questions</li>
                                <li>④ Auto renaming of all the components in 'component/states' format so that designers can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHEh9HFBtFU">swap</a> among the states easily on Figma.</li>
                                <h6>User Flows</h6>
                                <p>Then, I defined the ideal user flows of both the designers and developers based on the sketch as guides for my prototypes.</p>

                            <p>However, I find it really hard to create interactive prototypes to test the design and interactions in real scenarios. Therefore, I decided to develop real HTML/Javascript prototypes for user testing and iteration.</p>

                                <p>More usability studies are needed to improve the interface and user interactions</p>
                                <h6>Extreme Cases Definitions and Design</h6>
                                <p>There are some cases that users might not follow the ideal user flow. For example they select multiple component or select nothing. These extreme cases should be identified through ideation and testing and alternate user flows, alerts or notifications should be specified.</p>
                                <h6>More Components, More Features</h6>
                                <p>My next step is to ideate and prototype data components such as table, list and carousel. Moreover, I'm going to interview more designers to discover more components that designers ran into trouble specifying and communicating and continue to add new components to the plugin.</p>
