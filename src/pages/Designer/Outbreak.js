                                <p>2020 was doomed to be a special year. The COVID-19 outbreak swept over the world. People are more aware of the threats coming from contagious diseases and how outbreaks could be easily sparked and spread to every corner of the world. Since a growing number of people are curious about epidemics, we explored <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nors/index.html">the National Outbreak Reporting System (NORS)</a> within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and decided to visualize data of enteric outbreaks and reveal some important patterns of their spread. </p>

Therefore, the design was going to display the patterns we found in the data set in a visual and interactive way.</p>

As a result, we found out four different patterns that could be included in the final storytelling: time, states, settings and etiology. We also discovered outliners that we wanted to also showcase in our final design.</p>

                                <p>Since we were not public health professionals, we needed to spend time understanding all the variables and translate them into daily English. We think it would be helpful if we could employ a UX Content Strategist for consistent and concise messaging for the website.</p>

                                <p>Even though we conducted two rounds of testings, we still think that more testings are needed to evaluate some of the final designs. Seting up a booth on public places such as grocery stores or park might be a great way to reach the general population.</p>
